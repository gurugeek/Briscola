# Briscola

The application can be downloaded and used internally. Download the briscola.com folder. When the download finishes, just double-click the index.html file placed inside to open an application.

Everything will work flawlessly despite the player vs player part. To manage this work as well, you need to create an localhost on your computer. Just follow to steps explained in https://www.linode.com/docs/websites/hosting-a-websiteApp . The last part about how to publish the local host is not mandatory to get the full experience of the application. Also, here is need to install php5-mysql as well to get everything working. It allows php communication with mysql database. Make sure to set the password of your application on plugyca1 and create an database called Users. Now put the public_html content into created example.com file (following the steps from the link above, one should have create it), run chmod 777 public_html -R in terminal located in example.com folder to give the access of the content of the folder to the localhost. Now, open your browser and enter localhost/prepare.php . One should see: Class is okUsers created. waitList created. Playing created. Wait answer created.

The application is now hosted. Access it by typing localhost/ in your browser.
